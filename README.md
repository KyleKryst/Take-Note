## Description ##
My motivation to make this project was to be able to write and save notes. I built this project that I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete. Now with this project completed, it will allow me to have a site to write and store notes on so that I can easily check to see which tasks are currently completed and which need to still be worked on. It also allows me to check back on thoughts I have had in the past.. I learned throughout this project how to run an express.js back end and how to upload applications to Heroku.
